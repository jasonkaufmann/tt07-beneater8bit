# How it works
This is Ben Eater's 8 Bit computer on an ASIC!

# How to test
To program the computer follow these steps:

enable this design in TT (micropython or your own custom setup)
send prog_mode bit high
on each next clock pulse, put the desired 4 bit address you want to write to on the address lines along with the data to be stored there.
since this computer only has a 4 bit address space you can only store 16 total bytes for the program and memory
see https://eater.net/8bit/ on how to program the computer (what the opcodes are etc)

# External hardware
You will want to make the output register on a breadboard to connect it to the 8 bit I/O lines. See https://eater.net/8bit/output for detailed info.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
